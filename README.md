# Link Partitioning Around Medoids (lpam) â€“ Tool for Overlaping Communities Detection in Networks

## What it is? ##

This and java implementation of the method for finding overllaping communities  in networks

## Compilation ##
In order to repoduce all computation experiments you should compile all method in the related_methods directory 
and tool for measuring ONMI in the directory Overlapping-NMI. Just go to corresponding folder and type "cmake".
